# ISETBioJandJ

ISETBio implementation of a 4-AFC tumbling E experiment using custom PSFs and custom display SPDs.
The simulation characterizes performance as a function of the angular size of the letter E.

Noise-free cone mosaic responses to stimuli of different sizes (0.04, 0.08, and 0.104 degs) which result in different performance levels (Pcorrect: 0.26, 0.4, and 0.6) are shown below.
These results are for a 300 msec integration time.

Noisy response instances and noise-free cone mosaic responses to a 0.152 degs which results in Pcorrect = 0.95 are shown below.
These results are also for a 300 msec integration time.
